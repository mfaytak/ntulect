formant transitions and variation; formants as perceptually relevant:
Potter & Peterson 1948; Peterson & Barney (1952)

mel scale (engineering for more perceptual relevance) - Ladefoged 1967
Bark scale ("") - Zwicker 1961

source-filter theory providing clear physiological/articulatory correlates to formants (Chiba & Kajiyama, 1941; Fant, 1960)

Chiba, T., & Kajiyama, M. (1941). The vowel: Its nature and structure. Tokyo, Japan: Kaiseikan.

Probably cite "Acoustic Phonetics" in there somewhere, or review there

Complications: higher formants, formant differences, formant DYNAMICS especially, 


VOT: 

background research in physiology:

Ro. also notes:

background research in speech synthesis - literally the delay in turning on the voicing source in the synthesizer


While this one dimension is very useful and has descriptive power in its limited context:

However... 




NASALITY

ATR

Kirkham and Nance (2017)
Fulop et al. 1998

F1, F2, F3
A1-A2
B1 (bandwidth of F1 - lower for ATR)
Center of gravity
spectral tilt

Voice quality differences sometimes also recruited (Edmonson & Esling, 2006, Guion et al. 2008, Olejarczuk et al. 2019)

Inter-speaker variation in properties used (Kirkham & Nance; Olejarczuk et al)
