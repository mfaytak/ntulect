formant transitions and variation; formants as perceptually relevant:
Potter & Peterson 1948; Peterson & Barney (1952)

mel scale (engineering for more perceptual relevance) - Ladefoged 1967
Bark scale ("") - Zwicker 1961

source-filter theory providing clear physiological/articulatory correlates to formants (Chiba & Kajiyama, 1941; Fant, 1960)

Probably cite "Acoustic Phonetics" in there somewhere, or review there

Complications: higher formants, formant differences, formant DYNAMICS especially, 


VOT: 

background research in physiology:

background research in speech synthesis - literally the delay in turning on the voicing source in the synthesizer


While this one dimension is very useful and has descriptive power in its limited context:

However... 

Complications: doesn't extend well to preasiprated or breathy (murmured) stops


- citation for Indic langs. voiced aspirates would be useful

General overview: 

Also, quoting Rothenberg (2009):
p1: Disagreements arose as to where voice was to be judged to begin for an unvoiced stop.
p2:	Patterns of voicing for voiced stops could not be specified by a single number representing a negative VOT, and it was not clear why one should want to do this.


NASALITY

read Styler paper on nasalance, probably


ATR

not clear who to read: Casali?
